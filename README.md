# Welcome to Berlin Legal Tech Hackathon 2020!

This is the central repository for all technical materials you'll need to get organized and kickstart your hackathon weekend.

## Step 1: Brainstorm, Pitch and find a Team

## Step 2: Register your Team and Idea as an issue in this repository

Once you have found a team and decided on what you want to build, file your team as an "issue" here in this repository.

[See the example issue to understand which details to provide.](https://github.com/hacking-law/blt20/issues/1)

## Step 3: Let's go!

Good luck :-)
